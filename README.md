In the first part of the workshop, we will learn about the content-out approach to Web design and its role in today's multi-screen consumer landscape. We will look at how to achieve simple designs with good information architecture by using visual hierarchy, color, and typography.

In the second half, we will learn to work with repositories on GitHub and build our first responsive website using basic HTML and CSS. We will end off by hosting our finished site for free on GitHub Pages.
